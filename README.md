# DuelDot
A fast-paced 2D shooter where you control a circle and battle against other players using precision shooting and strategic movement. Dodge bullets, take down enemies, and climb the leaderboard in this minimalist but intense multiplayer arena! 

This is a starter project for the [Chris Courses Online Multiplayer Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcvqnx14cZA) available on YouTube. If you have any questions on what this template's logic is working, go to his channel.

To get started, download this repo and double click `index.html` to see the single-player game we'll base our multiplayer-game off of.

To run a liver server locally create a codespace within GitHub.
On the console type npm install.
Then type npm run dev.
Then it will open a browser with the .HTML file running.
If you close it by accident you can reopen it by typing http://127.0.0.1:8080 in a separate browser usually.
