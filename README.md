# DuelDot
A fast-paced 2D shooter where you control a circle and battle against other players using precision shooting and strategic movement. Dodge bullets, take down enemies, and climb the leaderboard in this minimalist but intense multiplayer arena! 

To get started, download this repo and double click `index.html` to see the single-player game we'll base our multiplayer off on.

No need to type npm install when running the server without auto reload.
There are two ways to start the server:
1. Run the server without back-end auto-reloading by typing npm start
2. Run the server with back-end auto reloading by typing npm run dev
    The server auto-updates whenever you save a file in the backend or frontend
