# DuelDot
A fast-paced 2D shooter where you control a circle and battle against other players using precision shooting and strategic movement. Dodge bullets, take down enemies, and climb the leaderboard in this minimalist but intense multiplayer arena! 

This is a starter project for the [Chris Courses Online Multiplayer Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcvqnx14cZA) available on YouTube. If you have any questions on what this template's logic is working, go to his channel.

To get started, download this repo and double click `index.html` to see the single-player game we'll base our multiplayer off on.

No need to type npm install when running the server without auto reload.
There are two ways to start the server:
1. Run the server without back-end auto-reloading by typing npm start
2. Run the server with back-end auto reloading by typing npm run dev
    The server auto-updates whenever you save a file in the backend or frontend
